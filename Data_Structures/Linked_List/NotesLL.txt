The self  

- "Class methods" must have an extra first parameter in the method definition. We do not give a value for this parameter
  when we call the method, Python provides it  (only the Class "Methods")
-If we have a method that takes no arguments, then we still have to have one argument.
-This is similar to this pointer in C++ and this reference in Java.
-When we call a method of this object as myobject.method(arg1, arg2), this is automatically converted by Python into
 MyClass.method(myobject, arg1, arg2) â€“ this is all the special self is about.
